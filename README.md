# Webhooks-Assignment-Sample-Repo

This repository demonstrates the solutions to the webhooks assignment.

When creating a pull request on the respository, a comment will be automatically generated, and review will be requested by the Codify-Berkeley github account.

To quicky create a pull request and try it yourself, click on the edit readme button, edit this readme, and then select "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request"

This demo will stop working because the access token will expire on: **August 8, 2025** (if this date has passed, bug me to update it)
